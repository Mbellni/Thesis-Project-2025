# Weekly Progress Journal (8th to 12th September)

This first week was focused on grounding my ideas and giving my project a solid foundation. I spent time brainstorming, refining, and ensuring that all the key details were aligned before moving forward. To begin, I created a written report that outlined the motivations behind my project, why it matters, and the broader research context within it.

This stage was important not only for clarifying my own vision but also for setting a direction that I can follow consistently throughout the thesis project. Although this first stage was mostly conceptual, it gave me the clarity and confidence to move forward with the next phases. Solidifying the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the project has made the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù much easier to start planning.

I also created a Figma page where I wrote down some very broad initial remarks and suggestions. However, I will mostly be using it for designing the scene and getting a nice mood board down before designing the space where the interaction will take place.

Furthermore, I had a meeting with my supervisor, which helped me refine and examine my ideas through fresher, more experienced eyes, as well as ensure I began thinking of this project within its research requirements. As a result, this led me to the second part of this week, where I worked on my research methodology report as well as developed an initial Google questionnaire that will ensure my data collection process is clear and smooth.
