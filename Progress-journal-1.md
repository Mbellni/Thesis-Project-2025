# Weekly Progress Journal (8th to 12th September)

This first week was focused on grounding my ideas and giving my project a solid foundation. I spent time brainstorming, refining, and ensuring that all the key details were aligned before moving forward. To begin, I created a written report that outlined the motivations behind my project, why it matters, and the broader research context within it.

This stage was important not only for clarifying my own vision but also for setting a direction that I can follow consistently throughout the thesis project. By putting these ideas into a structured document, I was able to:

Define the core aims of my research.

Identify the gap or problem my project seeks to address.

Explain the relevance and potential impact of the work.

Lay down an initial plan for methodology and next steps.

Although this first stage was mostly conceptual, it gave me the clarity and confidence to move forward with the next phases. Solidifying the “why” behind the project has made the “how” and “what” much easier to start planning.

Furthermore, I had a meeting with my supervisor, which helped me refine and look at my ideas through fresher, more experienced eyes, as well as make sure I started thinking of this project within its researchy reqcuirements. As a result this led me to the second part of this week, where I worked on my research methodology report as well as developed an initial gooogle questyionaire that will ensure my data collection process is clear and smnooth.
